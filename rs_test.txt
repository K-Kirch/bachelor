Randomly induced Error Tests: Test string 'This is a test message and my name is Kristian'
Starting with an error probability of 0.05 I have a significantly small probability as to where it is random whether errors actually occur
    Making minor increases in probability I will find the upper limit for the module
        Errors are induced on a byte level
    With the test string created, the high level implementation of Reed-Solomon FEC from the reedsolo module breaks with an error probability of 0.095 or 9.5%

Randomly induced Burst Error Test: Test string 'This is a test message and my name is Kristian'
Starting parameters error probability 0.1, max_burst_length 3, normal standard devitation 10, mean value 10
    Error probability can increase to 0.11 (or 11%) before it breaks at 0.12

Parameters are error probability 0.1, max_burst_length 3, normal standard devitation 20, mean value 20
    Error probability can increase to 0.11 (or 11%) before it breaks at 0.12
